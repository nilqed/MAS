There are no known bugs, however we disclaim any usefulness and make no warranty on the correctness of the Modula-2 Algebra System. For certain machines and/or operating systems further copying restrictions apply, e.g. see the files

    copying.mas, copying.reuse, copying.mtc, 
    copying.emx, copying, copying.lib and copying.bsd

in the exam directory. The C code has been generated from the Modula-2 sources of MAS with the 'mtc' 'Modula-2 to C' translator by GMD Karlsruhe. Although it is not required, you should get a copy of it from some ftp site to have the sources of the used libraries. The executables for PC have been compiled using the GNU gcc compiler with the emx runtime system by Ernst Mattes. The latest versions and documentation of emx can also be found on ftp servers.
