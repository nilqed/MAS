	    MAS, the Modula-2 Algebra System, Version 1.00
	    ==============================================

			  27th October 1996



Abstract 
--------

MAS (Modula-2 Algebra System) is an experimental computer algebra
system, developed at the University of Passau. MAS combines imperative
programming facilities with algebraic specification capabilities for
design and study of algebraic algorithms. It contains a large library
of implemented Groebner basis algorithms for nearly all algebraic
structures where such methods exist. MAS further includes algorithms
for real quantifier elimination, parametric real root counting, and
for computing in (noncommutative) polynomial rings.

This document describes the MAS distribution files, installation and
new things in this release.



Distribution files
------------------

The distribution is by means of gnuzip'ed tar files. Form the
distribution files you need at least an executable, the tutorial and
the examples.

If you pick the source code we recommend to pick also the definition
module and indexes document along with it. To compile the source code
you will also need the Modula-2 to C translator "mtc", the "reuse"
library, gnumake, and a C-compiler (preferably gcc).  Further we
recommend the GNU readline library and the kpathsea library.

The following files are available

Test
----
Test the installation with the following command 

             [path]mas -m 4000 -E -e -o test-all

from the /exam directory. This produces a file 'test-all.out' which
you can compare to the supplied 'test-all.orig' file. The warnings are
intentional and only lines with timings should "diff"er.



Start - Stop 
------------

Add the mas/bin directory to the PATH or use the complete pathname
in the following examples. 

   - start         'mas' or 'mas.exe' or 'emx mas.out'  

   - banner        'This is MAS the Modula-2 Algebra System, Version 1.xxx.'

   - system prompt 'MAS: ' 

   - system answer 'ANS: '

   - input (e.g.)  'a:=2*3.' A statement is terminated by period '.' 
 
   - help with     'help.' or 'help(name).' or 'help(name,Loaded).'
  
   - interupt      ^C     CNTRL-C 
 
   - leave with    'EXIT.' or 'exit.' or 'quit.'



Path and Compile
----------------

On all systems add the mas/<machine> directory to the PATH or use the
complete pathname to call the MAS executables.

On OS2 systems also add the mas/dll directory to the LIBPATH and
reboot or use your existing emx dlls.

To compile MAS unpack the source code and create a directory
"<machine>" for your machine type. From the directory mas/<machine>
execute ../configure to generate the Makefile, then execute gnumake to
compile a mas executable.

Further details can be found in the readme file accompanying the
source code.



Notes
-----

      - Some help facilities need an 'awk' program. 

      - The Makefiles for the source code may need an 
        'awk' or 'sed' program or other unix utilities.  



Release and Change Notes
------------------------

Major mathematical library changes of the current version 1.0 are:

     - arbitrary domain polynomial system extended to a generic
       Gr"obner base package.

     - added an optimized Gr"obner base package (including the
       ``sugar''-method) by C. Rose,

       J. Pfeil,

     - Improved comprehensive Gr"obner Basis algorithms using
       factorization, condition evaluation and case elimination by
       M. Pesch,

     - a package for involutive bases by R. Grosse-Gehling,

     - added a package for invariant polynomials by M. Goebel,

     - added a package for counting real roots based on Hermites
       method by F. Lippold,

     - added a logic formula representation with simplification

     - the linear algebra package of MAS has been improved.



Major system changes of the current version 1.0 are:

     - MAS language accepts small letter key words and braces {} to
       denote list expressions.

     - Distribution now uses GNU autoconf for easy compilation.
       
     - GNU readline for easier command line editing.

     - Using Kpathsearch Library from K. Berry.  

     - Improved batch processing capabilities. 

     - Improved error handling and user signal processing to examine
       long running computations.

     - Generic garbage collection support for most architectures.



Major mathematical library changes between release 0.6 and 0.7 are:

     - added comprehensive Groebner base package by E. Schoenfeld,

     - arbitrary domain polynomial system implemented,

     - added several new basic arithmetic packages: complex numbers,
       quaternion numbers, octonion numbers, finite fields,

     - added package for computation in non-commutative polynomial
       rings of solvable type: *-product, left Groebner base,
       two-sided Groebner base, elements in the center,

     - added a package for the computation of generators for the
       module of syzygies of systems of homogeneous polynomial
       equations and Groebner bases for modules over polynomial rings
       (also available for solvable polynomial rings) by J. Phillip,

     - added universal Groebner base package by T. Belkahia,

     - added d-Groebner base and e-Groebner base packages for Groebner
       bases over the integers and univariate rational polynomial
       rings by W. Mark.



The major system changes between release 0.6 and 0.7 (April 1993) are:

     - Distribution based on Modula-2 to C translator and a C
       distribution which will work on 'most' workstations.

     - New support for PC 386 and higher (OS2 2.0 and higher) with emx
       dll runtime libraries.
      
     - New support for PC 386 and higher (DOS 5.0) with emx DOS
       extender (10 times faster).

     - Dropped support for the Atari, Amiga and PC XT up to 286
       versions.  That means, that we do no more distribute
       executables for these systems, but if you have the maskern(el)
       you can get the new source code (except maskern) and compile it
       on your system.

     - The HELP and help command has been changed to provide name
       ranges and more information from the procedure comments.



The major changes between release 0.3 and 0.6 (March 1991) are:

     - added language extensions for specification capabilities,

     - added a parser for the ALDES language and possibility for
       interpretation of ALDES programs,

     - added a linear algebra package,

     - added an interface between the MAS language and the
       distributive polynomial system,

     - improved symbol handling by hash tables combined with balanced
       trees,

     - EMS support for IBM PC implementations.


The minor changes between release 0.3 and 0.6 are:

     - PRAGMA construct for the state definition of the MAS
       executable.

     - Overloading of MAS arithmetical operators by generic function
       names.

     - Typed string constants in MAS expressions.

     - VAR parameters in MAS procedure declarations in ALDES style.

     - Static scope analysis by the parser.

     - Explicit stack overflow check since not all compilers 
       handled stack overflow correctly.



Release notes for Version 0.3 (November 1989): 

     - The MAS parser has been changed for better Modula-2 
       compatibility. 

     - MAS LISP has been made more robust against incorrect user
       input.

     - The MAS main program has been enhanced to recognize the
       following command line parameters:

                -m number-of-KB     
                -f data-set-name

        - the memory option '-m' gives the number of Kilo-Byte
          storage, requested from the operating system. 

        - the file name option '-f' can be used to overwrite the
          default file name 'MAS.INI' during startup. With this
          option MAS can be run in batch mode if the EXIT 
          statement is contained in the data set.
