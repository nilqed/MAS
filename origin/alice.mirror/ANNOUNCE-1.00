MAS (Modula-2 Algebra System) is an experimental computer algebra
system, developed at the University of Passau. MAS combines imperative
programming facilities with algebraic specification capabilities for
design and study of algebraic algorithms. It contains a large library
of implemented Groebner basis algorithms for nearly all algebraic
structures where such methods exist. MAS further includes algorithms
for real quantifier elimination, parametric real root counting, and
for computing in (noncommutative) polynomial rings.

The last released version of MAS was version 0.7. From version 0.7 to
version 1.0 the following major changes have been made:

Mathematical library improvements
---------------------------------

- Groebner bases
  An optimized Groebner base package, which includes the
  ``sugar''-method and a better exploitation of Buchberger's second
  criterion has been implemented.

- Factorized Groebner Bases
  A package to compute factorized Groebner bases has been added.

- Comprehensive Groebner Bases 
  The CGB package for computing comprehensive Groebner bases has been
  extended. The occuring conditions can be exploited (by
  detecting implications and inconsistencies) to avoid unnecessary cases
  and factorized comprehensive Groebner bases can be computed.

- Involutive Bases 
  A package for computing involutive bases and factorized involutive
  has been added.

- Invariant Polynomials
  A package for reduction of invariant polynomials has been included.

- Counting Real Roots
  A package for counting real roots has been implemented. 

- Logic Formulae 
  A package for representation of logic formulae was included. It
  makes methods for formula simplification available on a new data
  structure for logic formulae.

- Linear Algebra
  The linear algebra package of MAS has been improved.

System Improvements
-------------------

- MAS language 
  The MAS language now accepts small letter key words. Braces {} can
  be used to denote list expressions.

- Makefiles and GNU autoconf 
  The installation of MAS has been simplified by using the GNU autoconf
  system and a new Makefile. done by the configure script.

- GNU Readline and History Library
  The terminal input and output interface has been modified to make use
  of the freely available GNU readline and history libraries.

- Kpathsearch Library
  The kpathsea library by K. Berry is now used by MAS.

- Shell command line options
  GNU getopt is now used as parser for this options and new command line
  options have been added to MAS.

- Interrupt handling
  An interrupt handler has been added to MAS which can react on the
  \verb/USR1/ signal by printing the actual state of computation.

- Garbage collection
  The garbage collector has been modified to automatically detect the
  necessary information on stack structure at runtime (to allow
  cross-compiling). It is no longer necessary to give values for
  "stack-offset" before compiling MAS. Furthermore the garbage
  collector now works on machines with reverse stack growth like those
  from HP.

- Compiler optimizations
  MAS has now been modified to allow use of the optimization
  possibilities of gcc.

- New Data Structure Concept
  This concept has been used in the DIPAGB package, the CGB package and
  to some extent in the MASIB, MASLOG and DIPDCGB packages.

- Generic Functions
  Generic functions on polynomial system over ``arbitrary domains'' have
  been designed and implemented.

- Selection of Options
  A concept for implementing run time options has been introduced.
  Options (e.g. how much intermediate output should be produced, which
  term order should be used, which strategy should be followed) can be
  set from the interpreter by special functions.
