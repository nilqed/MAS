 * $Log: CGBSYS.md,v $
 * Revision 1.9  1996/06/08 16:47:14  pesch
 * Reformatted, removed obsolete procedures.
 *
 * Revision 1.8  1995/03/06  15:49:41  pesch
 * Added new procedure GSYSF, Groebner system with factorization. This uses
 * the new procedures GBSYSF and CONSGBF (also added).
 *
 * Added new procedures DIP2AD, AD2DIP and DIPPFACTAV.
 *
 * Fixed error in CHECK.
 *
 * New option for factorization of conditions: factorize with optimization
 * of variable ordering.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  1994/04/10  16:57:44  pesch
 * Modified CONSGB. Returns its result now. When a condition is ramified,
 * we continue with this new case distinction first. This is useful to
 * have the generic case computed first.
